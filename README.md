# JSONConfig
SIMPL# Library for reading JSON config file. Use this library along with a SIMPL module to control a UI.

3 basic ideas

1) Get the initial information about the room: what sources can it access, what are they called.

2) When switching souces read data from the config file to get the Equipment ID, a value to know what subpage to show a name and other data.

4) Build the dynamic lists for Zone selection for things like Lights, Shades,HVAC.
